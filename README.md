# AuntiesAssemble
SWE'20 Project

AuntiesAssemble is a group project built for the Software Engineering course. Access through the link: https://cryptic-caverns-96197.herokuapp.com/.

Our Mission:
Since the UAE has a huge population of low-educated expats, ‘Aunties Assemble’ aims to allow the unemployed expat spouses/mothers to offer their cooking services to customers in the local area on a small scale.

The website aims to allow the unemployed people to increase their living standards by earning some extra income on a casual basis and use their home-economic skills and monetize them. It will aid the unemployed expats to increase their income and living standards. For the local residents, it aims to provide a greater range of culinary options according to their traditional/cultural food tastes. Thirdly, it is for tourists to enjoy home-made traditional dishes and experience the culture and food to its fullest.
